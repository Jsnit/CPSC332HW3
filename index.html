                Hello, my name is Jake Snitily, and I am a motivated and passionate student at Gonzaga University pursuing a B.S in Computer Science with a
                concentration in Cyber Security. I have a love for all things problem solving, and I excel when I'm directing
                projects and managing resources to ensure the success of a team. I am a long-time rock climber and skiier, and
                I love to be outdoors. Theres no better day to me, than a day I can completely unplug and be in remote nature.

                <li>Rock Climbing: Ever since I was a kid, my family would go out once or twice a summer and rock climb with my stepdad. It was here that my love grew, and now I am an avid climber as well, even joining the Gonzaga Climbing Club</li>
